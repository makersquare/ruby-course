class RPS
  # Rock, Paper, Scissors
  # Make a 2-player game of rock paper scissors. It should have the following:
  #
  # It is initialized with two strings (player names).
  # It has a `play` method that takes two strings:
  #   - Each string reperesents a player's move (rock, paper, or scissors)
  #   - The method returns the winner (player one or player two)
  #   - If the game is over, it returns a string stating that the game is already over
  # It ends after a player wins 2 of 3 games
  #
  # You will be using this class in the following class, which will let players play
  # RPS through the terminal.

#   @beats = {
#     rock: :paper,
#     paper: :scissors,
#     scissors: :rock
#   }

#   def play p1, p2

#     elsif p2 == @beats[p1]
#       puts "p2 wins"
#     else

# module Extensions
  # Extension Exercise
  #  - Takes an `array` of strings. Returns a hash with two keys:
  #    :most => the string(s) that occures the most # of times as its value.
  #    :least => the string(s) that occures the least # of times as its value.
  #  - If any tie for most or least, return an array of the tying strings.
  #
  # Example:
  #   result = Extensions.extremes(['x', 'x', 'y', 'z'])
  #   expect(result).to eq({ :most => 'x', :least => ['y', 'z'] })
  #
#   def self.extremes(array)
#     counts = Hash.new(0)
#     result = {}
#     array.each do |letter|
#       counts[letter] += 1

#     most << count.max_by{|k,v| v}.first
#     least << count.min_by{|k,v| v}.first
