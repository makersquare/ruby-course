To Do:
Request log spec 
  Need to modify pending request. i don't know how to handle
  this. 
  Need to automatically cycle through all of the holds
  and match puppies with the holds in order. Code is there.
  When I add the puppy it automatically runs a loop on all 
  holds to see if there is a match, and if there is, it calls
  another method which 
  1) updates the record of the puppy so it's availability changes to false indicating it's been
  reserved
  2) updates the request log with the id of the puppy
  3) updates the status of the request in the log from
  hold to accepted. 
  When I run rspec I get an error from the add_puppy method
  saying error: could not determine data type of parameter $1
  $1 is the puppy.name and 
  4) Figure out how to store the price to breed in two tables?
  	or just use the 3 table method

Done:
Puppy spec - checks for class instance creation and 
  for proper setting of instance variables
Purchase Request spec - checks for instance creation
  checks for pending status as default
  checks for the breed attribute being set
Inventory spec - checks for new inventory creation
  checks for log, checks to make sure puppy gets added
  to the repo.
Request Log spec - 
  adds a request to the database
  checks for the log
  sets the status to hold if no matching dog is available
  gets the pending requests
